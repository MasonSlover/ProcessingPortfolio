# ProcessingPortfolio
Hey! My name is Mason Slover and I am a mathematics and computer science student at Fordham University Lincoln Center. I have been creating art using Processing, a visual Java environment, for 5 years. This GitHub is a repository of some of my favorite works, some of which are open source. Here are a couple of my favorite pieces.

## Dynamic Variable Width Fonts
Using processing, I was able to import a variable width font and dynamically adjust the type's weight and height. Using sinusoidal speed changes and random character attributes, this project creates dynamic type that allows for extreme flexibility.
