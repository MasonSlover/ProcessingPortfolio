# ProcessingPortfolio
Hey! My name is Mason Slover and I am a mathematics and computer science student at Fordham University Lincoln Center. I have been creating art using Processing, a visual Java environment, for 5 years. This GitHub is a repository of some of my favorite works, some of which are open source.
